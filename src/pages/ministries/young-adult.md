Ever wondered if there was more to life than the mundane 9 to 5 (or perhaps 7 to 7) workday? The Young Adult department at New Covenant is a community of twenty and thirty-something working professionals and graduate students who believe that true meaning is found in the context of a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ. Through our small group meetings and fellowship activities, we strive to mature with one another in Christ as we learn and share life together. So, whether you are a seeker to the Christian faith trying to make sense of your busy life, or someone who has "grown up at church", we invite you to come and join us on this journey!
