The vision of the children's ministry has always been to raise children following the ABCs: the Attitude, Behavior and Character of Christ. In Matthew 22:37-39, Jesus says the greatest commandment is "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself." We are founded on the belief that true J.O.Y. comes from putting Jesus first, then Others, and then Yourself - hence our name! Come join us in JOY Adventure (4th-6th grade), JOYland (K-3rd grade), or JOY Corner (0-4 years old) as we lay the foundation for a lifetime of knowing, loving, and serving God!
