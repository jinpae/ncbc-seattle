Pastor Stephen Jung is the senior pastor at New Covenant Baptist Church (NCBC) in Seattle. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering from the University of California Berkeley and a Master of Divinity at Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary.

Pastor Stephen and his wife Ellen started their spiritual journey together on the UC Berkeley campus.  Their passion to follow God’s call led them to start NCBC in 1997 with the vision to share the Gospel to college students and young working professionals.  Together they lead the various departments and ministries at NCBC from teaching Bible studies to coordinating church-wide fellowship activities.

When he’s not preaching at the pulpit, and she’s not overseeing the diverse aspects of ministries at NCBC, you can find Pastor Stephen and Ellen leading a caravan of college students on a roadtrip, trekking up and on nearby mountains, offering counsel at their office hours, opening their home to you to simply hang out, or racing across fields/courts – whether basketball, soccer, tennis or volleyball. In whatever activity you catch both of them doing, you will find their childlike joy and spontaneity in Christ evident and extremely contagious.
