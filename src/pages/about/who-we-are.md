title: Who We Are!
---
In 1997 a small team, led by Pastor Stephen and Ellen Jung, moved to Seattle with the vision to share the Gospel with college students and working professionals in the Puget Sound area. What started out as a small group of founding members has become an enlarged family of new brothers and sisters in Christ, who together strive to live out Jesus' Great Commandment - to love God and love one another - as well as His Great Commission - to make disciples of all nations.

New Covenant Baptist Church originally started as a branch church of Berkland Baptist Church. Berkland was founded by Pastor Paul and Rebekah Kim on the border of Berkeley and Oakland, CA (hence the name "Berkland") in 1981. Over the years God has blessed BBC by enlarging it with branch churches throughout the United States and abroad. After 25 years of ministry, God has led us to new challenges as each branch church now serves independently, utilizing their unique gifts and talents for the Gospel.

On January 28, 2007, after celebrating its 10th anniversary, our church in Seattle took on the new name, New Covenant Baptist Church, with a renewed commitment to loving God and loving one another. Regardless of where you are in life's journey, we pray that you may find a spiritual home here at New Covenant.
