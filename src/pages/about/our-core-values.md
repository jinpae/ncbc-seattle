### The Word of God

"Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her. - Luke 10:41-42

What is the most important thing in our church? NCBC is committed first and foremost to studying and obeying the Word of God. In a world that operates according to programs and agendas, we are tempted, like the busy-body Martha, to forget the most important thing. At NCBC, we are reminded that we need to be like Mary, who sat and listened with reverence and delight at Jesus' feet, before we actively serve like Martha.

NCBC is committed to the study and teaching of God's word through quiet time, Bible studies, Sunday School, Sunday messages, seminars, retreats and discipleship training for personal growth and for the purposes of training and evangelism.

### Preciousness of One Soul

"Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders...and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.'" - Luke 15:3-7

Jesus taught us how precious one soul is through His parable of the shepherd who, after losing one of his 100 sheep, left the 99 to seek and to find that one lost sheep. Though some may scoff at this as being impractical and ludicrous by the world's standard, this illustrates God's tenacious and "wasteful" love. At NCBC, as we have experienced the same personal love from God, we strive to consider one another as valuable and precious as God does.

### Lordship

Then he said to them all: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me." - Luke 9:23

In Mark 14:1-11 we see the woman who breaks her alabaster jar to anoint Jesus, symbolizing her surrender of all her hopes in people, possessions, and her life purpose (which was her hope of security and love in marriage). Her act of devotion represents how she gave up all that was dear to her and acknowledged Jesus as her Lord. At NCBC, we look to this woman as the one who understood the life of a disciple of Christ, and we strive to live a life completely surrendered to God and free of all other sources of significance.

### Team Ministry and Covenant Relationships

Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God...The two of them made a covenant before the LORD. - 1 Samuel 23:16-18

The Bible abounds with beautiful examples of love/trust relationships. We believe that God desires that His church not only devote itself to loving Him intimately, but also to loving one another and working together toward the salvation of souls. Examples like Paul and Timothy, David and Jonathan, Naomi and Ruth serve as our models of covenant relationships. It is precisely within covenant relationships that we cultivate godly love, obedience, trust and sacrifice. At NCBC, we want to allow God to use our covenant relationships as channels for His will.

### Family of God

From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work. - Ephesians 4:16

In a world where relationships are disconnected and families fragmented, the family of God provides a place of true connection. As we cultivate relationships at NCBC, the church becomes a web of love, and we participate in establishing God's history and roots. At NCBC, we build up God's family just as the first church described in Acts did - through fellowship. Whether it is through food, games, trials, victories, or other memory-making moments, we join together as one body with Christ as the head.

### The World is our Mission Field

Beginning with one person, and going to the whole world, the NCBC family obeys God's commission to share His Good News to "the ends of the earth." As we expand God's tent, we are committed to strengthening each stake, holding nothing back, as we send out and support our long-term and short-term missionaries all over the world.

### Prayer and Intercession

Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on. - Mark 2:3-4

God wants us to pray to Him. Like these four friends, we trust that when we come to God in prayer and intercession with persistence and faith, He will answer. If the Word of God is the most important principle of the church, then prayer is the second most important, and the other five principles are held by them.
